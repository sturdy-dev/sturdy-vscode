# Sturdy

Sturdy is a code collaboration tool that makes working together simpler. Get notified in **real-time** about potential merge conflicts with other developers.

It works by first connecting with a GitHub repo. Then Sturdy proactively searches for merge issues between your local work and the (local) work of others. Because all the heavy work is done in the cloud, the extension does not slow down VSCode.

**Sturdy notifies you when you have a conflict with the default remote branch**

**Even if you haven't commited the changes yet**

## Features

Detects merge conflicts in **real-time**. Sturdy proactively searches for merge issues between your local work and the local work of other developers on your project.

### Conflicts with the remote **default** branch

When another developer on your team push changes to the default branch, Sturdy checks for conflicts with your local (unpushed) work and informs you of conflicts as soon as they occur.

### Conflicts of your **uncommitted** changes

Sturdy notifies you of merge conflicts as soon as you type the code, **before** you have even committed anything! By giving you an early heads-up you can make an informed decision and consider pulling the latest code first.
